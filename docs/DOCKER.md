# Docker Setup

This guide covers running Wulong using Docker in both development and production modes.

## Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop installed with Docker Compose V2
- Port 3000 available on your host machine

## Quick Start

### Development Mode (with hot reload)

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
```

### Production Mode (optimized build)

```bash
docker compose up
```

## Development Mode

Development mode uses hot reload and mounts your local code as a volume for live changes.

### Setup

1. **Create environment file** (optional for dev):
   ```bash
   cp .env.template .env
   ```

   The dev compose file has sensible defaults, but you can override in `.env`:
   ```bash
   NODE_ENV=development
   KMS_URL=http://localhost:8001/prpc/PhactoryAPI.GetRuntimeInfo
   ```

2. **Start development container**:
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
   ```

   Or run in detached mode:
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
   ```

### Features

- Uses [Dockerfile.dev](../Dockerfile.dev)
- Runs `pnpm start:dev` with hot reload
- Code changes are reflected immediately (volume mounted)
- Sets `NODE_ENV=development`
- Application available at `https://localhost:3000`
- TLS certificates generated automatically in container

### Stop Development Mode

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml down
```

### View Logs

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml logs -f
```

## Production Mode

Production mode uses a multi-stage build to create an optimized image.

### Setup

1. **Create production environment file**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.template .env.prod
   ```

   Configure production settings:
   ```bash
   NODE_ENV=production
   KMS_URL=https://your-kms.example.com/release
   ```

   No keys go in this file: the ML-KEM keys are derived inside the enclave from the dstack KMS, and startup fails if key material is found in env (see [KEY_DERIVATION.md](./KEY_DERIVATION.md)).

2. **Update docker-compose.yml** to use `.env.prod`:
   ```yaml
   env_file:
     - .env.prod
   ```

   Or source environment variables manually before running.

### Run Production Mode

```bash
docker compose up
```

Or run in detached mode:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### Features

- Uses [Dockerfile](../Dockerfile) (multi-stage build)
- Builds optimized production bundle
- Only `dist` and production dependencies, no pnpm
- Runs as the non-root `node` user, which can only write `/app/data`
- Sets `NODE_ENV=production`
- Application available at `http://localhost:3000`
- Uses HTTP (designed for TLS termination proxy like Phala)

### Stop Production Mode

```bash
docker compose down
```

### View Logs

```bash
docker compose logs -f
```

## Building Custom Images

### Build Development Image

```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile.dev -t wulong:dev .
```

### Build Production Image

```bash
docker build -t wulong:latest .
```

### Build for Different Platforms

For Phala Cloud or other AMD64 environments (from Apple Silicon):

```bash
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 -t wulong:latest .
```

Images that get deployed are not built by hand: see [Releases](#releases).

## Releases

On dstack, the attestation commits to the compose file, not to the image contents. A mutable tag such as `latest` would let whoever controls the registry ship different code under the same attested compose hash, so `docker-compose.yml` pins the image by digest, and that digest is built in CI from a tagged commit.

### Release → digest → compose hash

1. Push a `v*` tag. [`release.yml`](../.github/workflows/release.yml) builds the image for `linux/amd64`, pushes it to `ghcr.io/w3hc/wulong:<tag>`, attests its build provenance, and adds its digest to the GitHub release notes.
2. Pin that digest in `docker-compose.yml`:
   ```yaml
   image: ghcr.io/w3hc/wulong@sha256:<digest>
   ```
3. Deploy. The compose hash, which dstack extends into RTMR3, now commits to that exact image. See [TEE_SETUP.md](./TEE_SETUP.md#reproducing-rtmr3-from-the-compose-file).

### Checking a digest

The build is reproducible: the base image is pinned by digest, dependencies come from the lockfile, pnpm's timestamped state files are removed, and file timestamps are clamped to the tagged commit's time. CI builds every pull request twice and fails if the digests differ. To check a release yourself:

```bash
git checkout v0.2.0
export SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=$(git log -1 --format=%ct)
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 --provenance=false --sbom=false \
  --build-arg SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH \
  --output type=oci,dest=wulong.tar,rewrite-timestamp=true \
  --metadata-file metadata.json .
jq -r '."containerimage.digest"' metadata.json
```

It must print the digest in the release notes and in `docker-compose.yml`. The build needs a `docker-container` builder (`docker buildx create --use`). You can also check the provenance attestation:

```bash
gh attestation verify oci://ghcr.io/w3hc/wulong@sha256:<digest> --repo w3hc/wulong
```

### Upgrading from a root image

Images before v0.2.0 ran as root, so an existing `wulong-data` volume holds a `chest.json` owned by root, which the `node` user cannot rewrite. Stores then fail with `EACCES`. Hand the volume to `node` (uid 1000) once, before or right after the upgrade:

```bash
docker run --rm -v wulong-data:/app/data alpine chown -R 1000:1000 /app/data
```

A fresh volume needs nothing: Docker copies the image's `/app/data`, already owned by `node`.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Both modes use the following environment variables (configured in `docker-compose.yml` and `docker-compose.dev.yml`):

- `NODE_ENV`: Set to `development` or `production`
- `KMS_URL`: KMS service endpoint (default: `http://localhost:8001/prpc/PhactoryAPI.GetRuntimeInfo`)

To modify these, edit the respective `docker-compose` file before running.

### Ports

By default, the application runs on port 3000. To change this, modify the `ports` section in the docker-compose files:

```yaml
ports:
  - "8080:3000"  # Maps host port 8080 to container port 3000
```

## Docker Compose Configuration Files

### docker-compose.dev.yml

Development configuration with volume mounting:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  wulong:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.dev
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=development
      - KMS_URL=http://localhost:8001/prpc/PhactoryAPI.GetRuntimeInfo
    volumes:
      - .:/app
      - /app/node_modules
    restart: unless-stopped
```

### docker-compose.yml

Production configuration using pre-built image:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  wulong:
    image: ghcr.io/w3hc/wulong@sha256:<digest>
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    volumes:
      - /var/run/dstack.sock:/var/run/dstack.sock  # Required for TEE attestation on Phala
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=${NODE_ENV}
      - KMS_URL=${KMS_URL}
    restart: unless-stopped
```

**Note**: The `/var/run/dstack.sock` volume mount is required: the ML-KEM keys are derived through it (dstack ≥ 0.6.0), and production refuses to start without it.

## Troubleshooting

### Command not found: docker-compose

If you see `zsh: command not found: docker-compose`, use `docker compose` (with a space) instead of `docker-compose` (with a hyphen). Docker Compose V2 is now integrated into the Docker CLI.

### Port already in use

If port 3000 is already in use, either stop the conflicting service or change the port mapping in the docker-compose file:

```yaml
ports:
  - "8080:3000"  # Use host port 8080 instead
```

Or find and kill the process using port 3000:

```bash
# Find process
lsof -i :3000

# Kill process
kill -9 <PID>
```

### Container won't start

View logs to diagnose:

```bash
docker compose logs -f
```

Common issues:
- Missing environment variables
- Invalid ML-KEM keys
- Port conflicts

### Volume permission issues (Linux)

If you encounter permission issues with mounted volumes:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml down
docker volume prune
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
```

### Rebuilding after code changes

Development mode auto-reloads, but for production:

```bash
docker compose down
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up
```

### exec format error

This means the Docker image was built for the wrong architecture. Rebuild with:

```bash
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 -t wulong:latest .
```

### TEE attestation returns "platform": "none"

If deploying to Phala Network and attestation shows mock mode:

1. **Add volume mount** to docker-compose.yml:
   ```yaml
   volumes:
     - /var/run/dstack.sock:/var/run/dstack.sock
   ```

2. **Verify instance type** is TEE-enabled (e.g., `tdx.small`)

3. **Redeploy** with updated configuration

See [PHALA_CONFIG.md](./PHALA_CONFIG.md#troubleshooting) for detailed TEE troubleshooting.

## Performance Considerations

### Development Mode

- Volume mounting can be slow on macOS/Windows
- Consider using Docker Desktop's "VirtioFS" for better performance
- Hot reload watches all files in mounted volume

### Production Mode

- Multi-stage build reduces final image size
- Only production dependencies included
- No source files or dev tools in final image
- Optimized for deployment
